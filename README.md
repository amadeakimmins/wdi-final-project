Trello was really useful in the planning process to work out how much I needed to do and to keep track of what I had already done:

### Challenges and Problems

-  Getting the category filter on the index page to work by mapping over the array of categories and checking to see if the selected category existed in all the brands array of categories was challenging

- I used react-bootstrap for the first time with this project which worked well in the end but it was a challenge at first to get to grips with how it worked.

- I didn't have as much time as I hoped to do testing. I have a few back end tests running but none on the front-end so I will hopefully add them in the time after the course.

---

### Wins

- This project was really enjoyable. I aimed to keep the idea behind it simple and to focus on making it as clean and finished as I could. I love styling so this meant I could really put a lot of effort into making it look as good as I could in the week we had.

### Future Features

Features I would have liked to include:

- A page that can link it's users to methods for recycling clothes that they do not want anymore.
  - For example, places where they can sustainably dispose of clothese which can be found by post code.   
  - and possibly designers or people who buy or take old clothes and re style them.


- Also a rating system for just how green these brands are depending on a variety of different factors- what each supplier is promising in a comparable rating system.

- A blog where users can write articles about interesting stories related to sustainable and ethical production of clothing and beauty products.
