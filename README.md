### Trello

Trello was really useful in the planning process to work out how much I needed to do and to keep track of what I had already done:

### Challenges and Problems

- It was challenging at first to figure out the step-by-step process of building the app and inputting this into our Trello board so that we could divide the work and have a solid plan.

-  The meetup API was harder to implement than we thought it would be originally and took us longer than we expected to get it working and to find the correct url needed to get the response we wanted. Making a proxy request was challenging as it required a more intricate setup.

- The functionality behind a logged in user joining an existing meetup event from the API and displaying the single event on the show page was also more complicated than we originally expected. We had to save the information from the API we wished to display on the page.

---

### Wins

- The project seemed to flow very smoothly with no disagreements. We had frequent stand ups to discuss what we had achieved and what we were working on and what we were finding difficult. We worked really efficiently in a team and generally managed to meet our targets in time. We communicated frequently over slack which meant we always knew what the other team mate was working on.

- We are proud of all the functionality that we have produced in the project as well as the styling.

### Future Features

Features I would have liked to include:

- Expanding the app to give the user the ability to suggest restuarants, bars and activities, nearby the events or associated with them, on the groups that they join in the comment section.

- Support real-time messaging - allow users to message each other over the app.

- Link the app to city mapper so that users can get a route from their current location to the event.
